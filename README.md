Credit card fraud is a significant and growing problem in the financial industry, causing billions of dollars in losses annually. 
Fraudulent transactions can result in financial damage for both consumers and businesses, eroding trust in digital payment systems. 
As the volume of online transactions increases, the need for robust fraud detection systems becomes more critical. 
Traditional rule-based systems often fall short due to the evolving nature of fraud tactics, which necessitates the use of
advanced machine learning techniques to detect anomalies effectively. 
This project aims to build a predictive model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by leveraging historical data 
and applying machine learning algorithms.
